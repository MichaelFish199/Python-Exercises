# hi

This repository contains houndreds of exercises from all the notes that I acumulated over the first months of studying vanilla python.\
Each cell contains some data and exercise with expected result far on the right.\
Those exercises worked on Python version 3.9\
Each exercises can be done diffrently.\

I have much more of these in NotConvertedExercises folder, but convering it to nice jupyter notebook style was time consuming so i stopped.
